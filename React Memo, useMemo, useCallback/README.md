# React Memo, useMemo, useCallback

This project demonstrates the use of Memo and Callback.

useMemo and useCallback are not to be used in smaller scales. This is because they have their own *repercussions on resources* and especially **memory**. They are to be used only when larger chunks of code need not be re-rendered.
